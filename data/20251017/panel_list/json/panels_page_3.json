Individuals with CAS typically have very delayed development of first spoken words.

Other associated features may include hypotonia, seizures, and facial dysmorphism/dysmorphology.\r\n \r\nPMID: 38366112 summarises three gene discovery cohort studies of individuals with CAS. Diagnostic yield ranged between 26-42%.\r\n\r\nThe aetiology of CAS is complex.
