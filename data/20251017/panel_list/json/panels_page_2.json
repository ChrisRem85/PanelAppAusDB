It can also be used to direct analysis as part of fetal molecular autopsy.\r\n\r\nCommon example clinical indications include:\r\nâ¢ Multiple structural anomalies\r\nâ¢ Suspected skeletal dysplasias (IUGR of placental origin should be excluded)\r\nâ¢ Large echogenic kidneys (in the absence of ureter or bladder outlet obstruction)\r\nâ¢ Major CNS abnormalities (excluding neural tube defects)\r\nâ¢ Multiple contractures (excluding isolated bilateral talipes)\r\nâ¢ Nuchal translucency of greater than 6.5mm plus another anomaly (that can include a minor finding)\r\nâ¢ Isolated non-immune fetal hydrops (detected at or after the routine 18-20-week scan in the second or third trimesters), defined as fluid/oedema in at least two compartments (e.g. skin, pleural, pericardial or ascites).\r\n\r\nChromosomal microarray is strongly recommended prior to genomic testing.\r\n\r\nMore targeted panels such as Hydrops, Ventriculomegaly, Arhthrogryposis are also available.\r\n\r\nThis panel is based on a targeted virtual gene panel for developmental disorders developed by the PAGE (Prenatal Assessment of Genomes and Exomes) group, Lord et al 2019, and subsequent refinement by Genomics England/NHS Genomic Medicine Service.

This panel has been developed to address the lack of a dedicated diagnostic gene panel specifically targeting recurrent pregnancy loss and/or infertility. This panel includes genes associated with a broad spectrum of male and female infertility phenotypes, as well as those implicated in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).\r\n\r\nFor male infertility, it covers genes involved in spermatogenic failure and fertilization defects. For female infertility, it includes genes associated with primary ovarian insufficiency/failure and ovarian dysgenesis. This panel also includes genes associated with infertility phenotypes that affect both sexes, such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, gonadal dysgenesis, Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Genes associated with RPL primarily involve in oocyte, zygote, and embryo maturation arrest (OZEMA), as well as defective implantation and placentation.\r\n\r\nSources used to generate this panel includes literature review and publicly available databases (e.g., OMIM, FeRGI database, Intolerome Gene List).\r\n\r\nPlease also consider the Fetal anomalies panel where appropriate, particularly in cases of pregnancy losses occurring beyond 20 weeksâ gestation.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank Jasmine Chew (University of Western Australia), Prof Gina Ravenscroft (Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research), Dr Harmony Clayton (PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Perth) and Audrey Rick (Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research) for the development of this panel.",

It therefore excludes genes listed in the Incidentalome, such as those associated with some cardiac disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, and neurodegenerative diseases. If analysis of these genes is required, the relevant disease-specific panel (e.g. Adult Additional Findings, Neurodegenerative Disease_Adult Onset, Regression, Breast Cancer) should be requested.\r\n\r\nPlease note that mitochondrially-encoded genes may only be analysed as part of some genomic tests, e.g. WGS with appropriate accreditation in place. If uncertain, please contact your test provider.\r\n\r\nSTRs are currently on this panel as \u0027grey\u0027 due to lack of clinical accreditation for STR analysis in Australian laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis panel was originally developed by VCGS and is a consensus panel used by RMH.",
